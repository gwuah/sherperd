A twitter account growth service that I was building.<br>

# Concept

It operates on a simple concept, there are power accounts (one's with large following)<br/>
So when they tweet, you quickly reply with a tweet (asking for people to follow you)<br/>
When they follow you, you follow back.<br/>
Also there's functionality to find people who only follow to unfollow so you can trim unfaithful followers<br/>

# Understanding

Check  `config.js` and `index.js` for help. (It's documented)

# How to run

Run your ``` npm install ```

and run ``` node index.js  ```
